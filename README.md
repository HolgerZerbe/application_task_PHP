# application_task_PHP
application task, creating a table with data from one input field using PHP

This time coded in PHP.
The logic is nearly similar to that repository with JavaScript (https://github.com/HolgerZerbe/application_task)
so the comments are shorter this time.

Start your PHP server and look at localhost in your browser
